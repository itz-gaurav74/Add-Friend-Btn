# Add Friend Button

This project demonstrates a simple "Add Friend" button functionality implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The project consists of a card displaying a user's information with an image, name, and relationship status. There's also a button labeled "Add Friend." When clicked, the button toggles between adding and removing the friend. If the user is currently a stranger, clicking the button changes the text to "Friends" and updates the button style. If the user is already a friend, clicking the button changes the text back to "Add Friend" and reverts the button style.
